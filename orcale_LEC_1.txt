
oracle middleware
oracle 
oracel provide DBMS  not database itself
vendor of Database in market find at least 15?
RDBMS:-
maintain data in the table called rdbms that will dynamically increase or decrease
interaction will possible with sql so its easy to retrieve the data
access using qurey also called sql 



os=oracle instance + oracle db 
host based system:-
client - server system :-
n-tier arch:-
sql is  declarative language, known as unified language means commaon for all the rdbms not the procedural language.
PL-SQL is procedural language.
sql keywords are not case sensitive as well as the statement also not case sensitive.
***the value that you are giving to the query is case sensitive  so you should give the as it is present in the db***
***Date should be in single quotes, format is 'DD-MM-YYYY'
every sql statement should end with semi_colon;
ANSI standard sql: comman lang to all vendor
sql* sqlplus
host-range:- address of the server, cryptic name of the server


commands:-
set pagesize 80:- for the proper size of the page
set linesize 120
select * from dept;
cl scr:- clearing screen
For a fresh line :- put a dot and enter
/:- this is for the last executed qurey in the memory


DQL(data query language) , DRL  (data retrivl language ) 	---- SELECT
DML (data manupulate language)                                 	---- INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE 
DDL (data Defination language)			  	---- CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME
DCL (data control )				  	---- GRANT, REVOKE
TCL (transaction control lanuage)                                	---- COMMIT, ROLLBACK

properties :-

DQL(data query language) :- to retrieve data only , does not modify the data
capabilities:- it can select, it can project
	eg. select * from emp;
	      it is projecting the things what are the specified after the select statement
                      projection is achieved on the basis of what you are going to write after the select statement 
	      after the select keyword you only eliglible to select columns not rows......	
	      we always project the column in the table
	    we can also have derived column in the select clause
eg:-   	
	select SAL, SAL*12 from emp;
        	selct SAL, SAL*3 from emp;
	selct SAL, SAL*6from emp;
	selct SAL, SAL from emp;
alias:-	another name for the column 
eg:- 	selct SAL, SAL*3 quat_sal, SAL*6 half_sal, SAL*12 annl_sal from emp;	
       			            or 
	selct SAL, SAL*3 AS quat_sal, SAL*6 AS half_sal, SAL*12 AS "annl sal" from emp;	
	alias should be complete 1 word not a 2 different word     
	if you want to give the space than give the name in the double quotes
Hike sal
	select SAL,  SAL+100 hiked_sal , SAL+100 * 12 from emp;
Predefind function or aggregate function or multiple row funtion or group funtion:-
	sum-
	selct sum(SAL), MIN(SAL), MAX(SAL), COUNT(SAL) , AVG(SAL)from emp;

Latest string                                  
	select 'GOOD MORNING' from emp ;
	it will appear as same as number of rows are present
DUAL 	
	select ' GOOD MORNING ' from dual ;
	one time 
	select sysdate from dual;
	single date for testing 
	select ENAME || 'works AS' || JOB from emp;
||	concatenation operator for sql 

DISTINCT unique not duplicate
 
eg:-	select DISTINCT deptno form emp;
	it gives the unique value from the table or non duplicate values
rules	
	distinct keyword should be used immediately after the select keyword
	it should not be used elsewhere in the remaining query 
	when you use distinct after the select keyword than it makes uniqe all the coloumn automatically
eg:-	select DISTINCT DEPTNO ,job fromp emp order by deptno,job ;
	select DISTINCT DEPTNO ,job fromp emp order by 1,2 ;

where cluase: it filter the desired output based on the condition which specify

eg 	 select * from emp where deptno =10; < > >= <= <> !=
	write a query that gives the info of 10 as well as 20 
	 select * from emp where deptno =10 AND deptno =20;  wrong 
	select * from emp where deptno =10 OR deptno =20;
	WAQ
	deptno=10 and sal>=1000 and all them are either salesaman or clerk

	select * from emp where deptno=10 or sal >1000 or job=cleark AND job=salesman;wrong done by me

	select * from emp where deptno=10 AND sal >1000 AND ( job='cleark' OR  job='salesman' );
	
comparison operator:-
	BETWEEN , AND
	IN

eg:-	select * form emp where sal between 1000 and 3000;
	select * form emp where sal between 1000 OR 3000; check it

	it will give the records that are not in 1000,1500,3000,2000

eg:-	select * form emp where sal NOT IN (1000,1500,3000,2000); 
	select * form emp where sal beetwen (3000 and 10000); 

eg:- 	select sal , comm , sal+comm from emp;
	it does not include the null values and dont include in the final output
 
eg:-	slect sal, comm , sal +NVL(comm,0) from emp;
	if commission is not there than it puts the 0 and include in the final output
	
	when you will not specify the order of the data than it will not come in the sequence. so for this you have to give the order by 

eg:- 	select ename from emp order by ename ;
	seklect sal from emp order by sal; by defaul asc
	select sal from emp order by sal desc;

	select deptno ,sal from emp order by deptno ,sal;

	select deptno ,sal from emp order by 1 ,2; write
	select deptno ,sal from emp order by 2,1; write
	select deptno ,sal from emp order by 1,3; wrong

select
from 
where
order by
group by
having



Like:-
where ename = 'scott'
where ename like 'S%' :- it means first charcter is S and we dont know about the rest of the char
'%' is used to represent multiple and '_' is used to represent the single character 
	select * from emp where comm = null; wrong
	select * from emp where comm is null:  given the output that is null 
	select * from emp where comm is NOT null;  gives the output which is not null
	
	 order by is basically used for the sorting of the data

	extraction transformisson and Model (ETM)

	grouping is used for the aggregation fucntion

GROUP by:

	:-select deptno, sum(sal) from emp group by having sal>1000 deptno order by 1,2

	:-it will give the total salary according to the deptno.

	:-we cant use ename here because coloumn that you are grouping that should be projected not the any other column 

	:- if you want to filter group value than you have to use "HAVING"; 


	:-select deptno, sum(sal) from emp where sal>2000 group by deptno                                                   
	having sum(sal) <10000	
	order by 1,2;

	:- select deptno, min(sal) from emp group by deptno order by 1,2

	:- select deptno, max(sal) from emp group by deptno order by 1,2

	:-select deptno, avg(sal) from emp group by deptno order by 1,2

	:-select deptno, round(avg(sal))from emp group by deptno order by 1,2
